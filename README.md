# Nintendo-BOTW-DevOps-Lab
Open source GitHub lab aimed at creating and managing feature pipelines during SDLC for Nintendoâ€™s BOTW. Feature branches are created, issues are tracked, GitHub Projects are used, and Pull Request Review is also incorporated in order to mimic as many actual game development processes as possible.

Created two new feature branches
- feature/korak-seed-ui
- feature/shrine-history-ui

Created a production branch (prod) for final release

Main branch will act as staging for production
